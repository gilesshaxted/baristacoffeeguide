# Privacy Policy for Barista Guide

**Last updated:** 01/01/2026

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to **Barista Guide** ("we," "our," or "us"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy.

## 2. Information Collection and Use
We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) from users of the Barista Guide app.

* **No User Accounts:** You do not need to create an account to use the App.
* **No Tracking:** We do not track your location or usage data.
* **No Data Storage:** All calculations (timers, recipes) are processed locally on your device and are not transmitted to any external server.

## 3. Permissions
The App requires minimal permissions to function on your Android device. It does not access your contacts, camera, microphone, or storage files.

## 4. Third-Party Services
The App is built using standard Android libraries. While the App itself collects no data, the Google Play Store (where you downloaded the App) may collect anonymous usage statistics and crash reports governed by Google’s own privacy policy.

## 5. Children’s Privacy
Our App does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. Since we do not collect data from any user, this applies to children as well.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted.
